A non-maintained Objective-C implementation of the WOOT (Without Operational Transformations) algorithm by [GÃ©rald Oster, Pascal Urso, Pascal Molli, Abdessamad Imine](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00071240/document)

This was originally written for an iOS app I was working on many years ago.

You can find a relatively recent article discussing possible improvements to WOOT here: https://medium.com/@raphlinus/towards-a-unified-theory-of-operational-transformation-and-crdt-70485876f72f
